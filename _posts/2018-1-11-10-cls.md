The name "10 CLS" comes from the QBasic. In my school, Programming was taught only from Grade 6(or 7 or 8, I dont quite remember) but I knew earlier through my elder brother that some thing called QBasic would be taught. He used to show me some programs. The first line of almost every program he showed read "10 CLS". 

Later only I knew what it meant. "10" was the line number and "CLS" was to clear the screen. So basically, it would clear the screen for each new program. 

And thus my interest for coding also began with "10 CLS".
