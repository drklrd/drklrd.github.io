title: Behind the blog name

The name "10 CLS" comes from the QBasic. In my school, the programming was taught only from class 6. But I knew earlier from my brother that some thing called QBasic would be taught. He used to show me the program and what it would produce. The first line of almost every program was "10 CLS". 

Later only I knew what it meant. "10" was the line number and "CLS" was to clear the screen. So basically, we are clearing the screen for each new program. 

And thus my interest for coding also began with "10 CLS".
