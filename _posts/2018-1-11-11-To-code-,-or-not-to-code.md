title: To code, or not to code
---


To code, or not to code, that is the question! As a developer, there is an urge in me to directly dive into coding without actually knowing and understanding if that is needed. Because something that we are trying to create may already be there(**so why reinvent the wheel, when you can actually start driving**) and some problem might not even need any program( As suggested in [this article by Samer Buna](https://medium.com/@samerbuna/software-engineering-is-different-from-programming-b108c135af26))

So before writing code for anything, it is advisable (and quite necessary) to understand if there are already some tools for the same or their limitations. And if you are still inconvinced of them(or you feel you need to), then only begin to write. Ask questions to yourself before beginning to write though(Why are you writing the code ? Why you are actually doing it ? Are you doing that just for the sake of doing or you actually want to solve it ? blah blah blah....)

It is always better to spend some time analyzing ground facts before jumping into invoking code functions.
