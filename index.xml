      <description>I have been working with maps for some years now. But I have little tried to understand the core working of them. Realizing this, I am now trying to understand behind the scenes of many spatial concepts. I want to start that by understanding the functions behind TurfJS, thus the name &amp;ldquo;Unturf&amp;rdquo;.

      <title>More Walks To Map Them All!</title>

      <description>I really love to walk. Walking is my best way of clearing my thoughts, thinking over something, or even to “un-think” of something. If a place is within walkable distance (and within a reasonable time), I prefer to walk.
Lately, I have been on an evening mapping streak for some days with strolls around my neighborhood. It warms up the body in this colder season and provides a form of physical exercise.</description>

      <title>Getting the length of JSON object with command-line using jq</title>
      <link>https://drklrd.github.io/posts/jq/</link>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor called jq. It has wide range of capabilites but something that I came across lately and is quite useful for me is printing out the length of a JSON object.
cat testjson.json | jq &amp;#39;. | length&amp;#39; </description>

      <description>We usually talk about improving lives of people through the use of technology and simplifying things for them. But, I usually encounter people who are far above the reach of what we are doing. We talk about big things, while they are happy with any small thing they have. I have always believed that - technology, whatever advance it may be, can never be greater than the solution it brings. Hope we just don&amp;rsquo;t get involved in a futile technological pursuit while whom we fight for have already found some other simple way out.</description>

      <description>I had a difficult time with Asterisk server last Friday (January 19th ,2018). We were running an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system with Asterisk and Digium TDM410P card on Ubuntu 16.04. The computer where Asterisk server was running went off and I had to restart the system. It was normally an easy process. Sometime the Dahdi configuration would mess-up and I had to recompile that (At that time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know why it needed to be recompiled, but it was also an easy task following the guide we had prepared).</description>

      <title>OSM API Explorer</title>

      <description>Few months ago, I had to work with OSM(Open Street Map) API(0.6) for a Web app. Some of the APIs were authenticated(it supported either basic authentication using username and password or OAuth).
But to just test out the API endpoints for responses, it was much of an effort to provide username and password for basic authentication or include authentication token in every protected requests. I felt need of some kind of playground for the APIs.</description>
