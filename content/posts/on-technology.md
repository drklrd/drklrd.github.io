We usually talk about improving lives of people through the use of technology and simplifying things for them. But, I usually encounter people who are far above the reach of what we are doing. We talk about big things, while they are happy with any small thing they have. I have always believed that - technology, whatever advance it may be, can never be greater than the solution it brings. Hope we just don't get involved in a futile technological pursuit while whom we fight for have already found some other simple way out.
