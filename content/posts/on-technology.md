While we usually go on about improving lives through the use of technology and simplifying things for people, I usually encounter people who don't care about that. And I have really begun to doubt - whatever we do will actually improve anything for them. They just don't care. They are just as they are. We talk about big things, while they are happy with the small things they have. I have always believed that - technology, whatever advance it may be, can never be greater than the solution it brings. Hope we just don't get involved in a technological war while whom we fight for have already found some other simple way out.
