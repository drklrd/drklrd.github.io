I really love to walk. Walking is my best way of clearing my thoughts, thinking over something, or even to ‚Äúun-think‚Äù of something. If a place is within walkable distance (and within a reasonable time), I prefer to walk.

Lately, I have been on an evening mapping streak for some days with strolls around my neighborhood. It warms up the body in this colder season and provides a form of physical exercise. And mapping, while I stroll, I can contibute to keep OpenStreetMap (OSM) data updated. Whenever I get to a new place and it's not on the map, I usually map it on OSM. But mapping during evening strolls is something I resumed after quite a while.

Since I live in Chabahil (a neighborhood in Kathmandu), my walks are mostly around the vicinity (_Boudha, Mahankal, Kapan, Kalopul, Naxal, Gaushala, Battisputali, Gahana Pokhari_). I observed that many new businesses have opened up and some previous ones closed. Marts, Department Stores, or Fast-Food chains have reached the core of the neighborhood. I guess every _tole_ now has a _The Burger House and Crunchy Fried Chicken_ üòÑ. And many new tea-houses have opened up (a good news for a chiya lover like me!)

Considering my last 5 tracks, I walked for a total of (7.89 + 9.63 + 3.87 + 4.46 + 5.11 = 30.96 KM). The time recorded for these tracks is not that much accurate, as often I would meet a friend for a cup of tea and stay within a place for some time (and because I could forget to resume tracking later, I never paused the tracking ). I mapped 105+ Points of Interest (POIs) with what my eyes could catch. It included the following amenities.

> _*restaurant, banquet/events venue, bar, mart, clinic, cafe, electronics store, meat shop, school, college, furniture store, video_game station, shoe store, atm, bakery, pharmacy, dentist, hairdresser, place of worship, cosmetics, veterinary, computer repair store, bank, departmental store, police station, convenience store, clothes store, optician, confectionary/cake, community center, fast food, hotel, automobile center, photography service, servicing center, book store, boutique, toys store, insurance office, complex building, laboratory, fitness center, government office, cooperative*_

I used [OSM Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmtracker&hl=en&gl=US) to record the GPX track and [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/) to collect the POI. Few things regardng the experience of this that I can recall have been:

- Given that I have long legs, I walk a little fast. And, it's not easy to walk slowly to record a POI.
- Going different paths while starting and returning, will allow to cover more/diverse area.
- But going the same path while starting and returning, also provides a newer perspective - the thing I missed while starting was likely to be noticed while returning.
- It was not feasible to record all POIs in a single go (given I had a limited time). I might need to travel the same track again. So, as opposed to [_One Ring to Rule Them All_](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/One_Ring) in [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings), here we need _More Walks To Map Them All!_
- I need to be careful while recording the POI - as most of the roads here do not have proper footpaths. So, its safe to stop walking while recording a POI to avoid any accident.

There's a feeling of accomplishment, both to start the GPX tracking while I leave my house and stop it later when I return and upload my changes to OSM. These evening mapping strolls are also an effort to enrich data for [Baato](https://baato.io), a maps based APIs service for Nepal using OpenStreetMap data that I am helping to build and grow with my colleagues.

We take things on the map for granted, but the effort of putting things there is something to highlight. A huge shout-out to all the lovely volunteers that are making OpenStreetMap possible. Enriching map data comes at a great cost (voluntary participation/human resource, time, effort, capital, etc.). But if one person can add around 100 POIs, 5 can add more than 500, and so on! I leave the math for the readers.
