      <description>While we usually go on about improving lives through the use of technology and simplifying things for people, I usually encounter people who don&amp;rsquo;t care about that. And I have really begun to doubt - whatever we do will actually improve anything for them. They just don&amp;rsquo;t care. They are just as they are. We talk about big things, while they are happy with the small things they have. I have always believed that - technology, whatever advance it may be, can never be greater than the solution it brings.</description>

      <title>Getting the length of JSON object with command-line using jq</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor called jq. It has wide range of capabilites but something that I came across lately and is quite useful for me is printing out the length of a JSON object.
cat testjson.json | jq &#39;. | length&#39; </description>

      <description>I had a difficult time with Asterisk server last Friday (January 19th ,2018). We were running an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system with Asterisk and Digium TDM410P card on Ubuntu 16.04. The computer where Asterisk server was running went off and I had to restart the system. It was normally an easy process. Sometime the Dahdi configuration would mess-up and I had to recompile that (At that time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know why it needed to be recompiled, but it was also an easy task following the guide we had prepared).</description>

      <title>OSM API Explorer</title>

      <description>Few months ago, I had to work with OSM(Open Street Map) API(0.6) for a Web app. Some of the APIs were authenticated(it supported either basic authentication using username and password or OAuth).
But to just test out the API endpoints for responses, it was much of an effort to provide username and password for basic authentication or include authentication token in every protected requests. I felt need of some kind of playground for the APIs.</description>
